# PixiSphere
Pixisphere is a full-stack AI-powered photography service marketplace that connects
clients with verified photographers and studios across India. It's engineered to handle
end-to-end workflows: from discovery and shortlisting, through intelligent lead distribution,
to post-booking lifecycle management.

#### The platform supports:
- Dynamic service discovery based on categories and geo-location
- Client inquiries with smart suggestions and reference image uploads
- Vendor dashboards with lead, booking, and portfolio tools
- Admin backend with moderation, verification, and CMS control
Pixisphere is not a typical marketplace. It operates with complex, role-based user flows,
multi-model data structures, AI-aided matching, and moderated interactions â€” all while
being scale-ready for high-traffic content management and real-time services.
